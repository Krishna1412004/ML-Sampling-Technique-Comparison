# **Discussion: Evaluation of Machine Learning Models with Different Sampling Techniques**

## **Introduction**

In this project, we evaluate the performance of five machine learning models across five sampling techniques. The goal is to identify the most effective sampling method for each model based on various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. We aim to determine which combination of model and sampling method yields the best results.

## **Models Used**

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Decision Tree Classifier**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model was evaluated across five different sampling techniques to determine the best-performing combination.

## **Sampling Techniques**

1. **Random Sampling**:
   - This is the most basic sampling method, where data points are randomly selected from the entire dataset.
   
2. **Systematic Sampling**:
   - In systematic sampling, we select every nth data point from the dataset. For instance, every 10th data point could be sampled.
   
3. **Stratified Sampling**:
   - Stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of the target class is maintained in the sample. It is useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

4. **Cluster Sampling**:
   - Cluster sampling divides the dataset into clusters and then samples entire clusters. This method is useful when the data is naturally grouped into clusters.

5. **Bootstrap Sampling**:
   - Bootstrap sampling involves creating multiple samples from the original dataset by sampling with replacement. This technique helps in reducing bias.

## **Performance Metrics**

We evaluate model performance using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made by the model.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives in the dataset.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **ROC-AUC**: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which evaluates how well the model discriminates between classes.

## **Key Findings**

- **Best Sampling Method for Logistic Regression**: Stratified Sampling provided the highest accuracy and better handling of imbalanced classes compared to other sampling methods.
- **Best Sampling Method for Random Forest**: Random Sampling showed high accuracy, but Bootstrap Sampling demonstrated robustness when handling variance in the dataset.
- **Best Sampling Method for SVM**: Stratified Sampling significantly improved the model’s ability to predict the minority class, boosting the ROC-AUC score.
- **Best Sampling Method for Decision Tree**: Cluster Sampling gave better results, especially in datasets with natural groupings.
- **Best Sampling Method for KNN**: Stratified Sampling led to the best performance, as it helped in maintaining class distribution, which is important for KNN’s distance-based approach.

## **Conclusion**

The results suggest that **Stratified Sampling** often provides the best accuracy for models, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. For more robust models like **Random Forest** and **KNN**, **Bootstrap Sampling** and **Stratified Sampling** were particularly effective. 

It is crucial to choose the appropriate sampling technique based on the nature of the dataset and the model being used. For datasets with natural groupings, **Cluster Sampling** may be more effective, while **Stratified Sampling** is ideal for imbalanced datasets. 

By understanding the relationship between models and sampling techniques, this study helps to choose the right combination for improving model performance.
