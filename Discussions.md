Discussion: Sampling Techniques vs. Model Performance
Overview
This project evaluates the impact of different sampling techniques on the performance of five machine learning models. The goal is to identify which sampling method provides higher accuracy for specific models and to analyze how sampling impacts other performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Key Findings
Random Sampling:
Provided consistent results across all models.
Performed best with Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors.
Systematic Sampling:
Worked well with Decision Tree but had lower accuracy on other models.
Its effectiveness may depend on the structure of the dataset.
Stratified Sampling:
Best suited for imbalanced datasets as it ensures proportional representation of each class.
Delivered the highest accuracy for Random Forest.
Cluster Sampling:
Accuracy varied depending on how clusters were formed.
Showed average results across most models.
Bootstrap Sampling:
Performed well with ensemble models like Random Forest, leveraging the model's robustness to overfitting.
Methodology
Dataset:
A sample dataset was used (replaceable with any user-defined dataset).
Features (X) and labels (y) were split appropriately.
Machine Learning Models:
Five models were trained and evaluated:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Sampling Techniques:
Random Sampling: Randomly selects samples from the dataset.
Systematic Sampling: Selects every nth sample from the dataset.
Stratified Sampling: Ensures proportional representation of each class.
Cluster Sampling: Divides the dataset into clusters and samples one or more clusters.
Bootstrap Sampling: Samples with replacement, often used with ensemble methods.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
Implementation Details
Each sampling method was applied to the dataset, and models were trained on the resampled data.
Performance metrics were computed for each model-sampling combination.
The highest accuracy for each model was identified and compared.
Results
Logistic Regression:
Performed best with Random Sampling.
Random Forest:
Achieved the highest accuracy with Stratified Sampling.
Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Worked effectively with Bootstrap Sampling.
Decision Tree:
Showed the best performance with Systematic Sampling.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Performed well with Random Sampling.
Conclusion
This analysis highlights how the choice of sampling technique can influence the performance of machine learning models. Models like Random Forest and SVM benefit from robust sampling strategies like Stratified Sampling and Bootstrap Sampling, while simpler models like Logistic Regression and KNN work well with Random Sampling.

This project underscores the importance of aligning sampling techniques with the characteristics of the dataset and the machine learning models used.
