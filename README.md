## **Introduction**

In machine learning, data sampling plays a critical role in ensuring model performance and robustness. This project compares five popular models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) across five sampling techniques (Random Sampling, Systematic Sampling, Stratified Sampling, Cluster Sampling, Bootstrap Sampling). The results help determine which model performs best under each sampling technique.
